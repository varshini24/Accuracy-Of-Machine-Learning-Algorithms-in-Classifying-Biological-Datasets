# Accuracy-Of-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-in-Classifying-Biological-Datasets

A tableau visualization of the accuracies of different machine learning algorithms on classifying different biological data sets. 
I used the classification rates of different machine learning algorithms using BIOCAT (BIOlogical Image Classification and Annotation Tool) and modified the source code to output an excel file which can be used to feed tableau. I used the image data from NIH (National institute of Health) to feed BIOCAT.
